# Node.js Form Builder with MongoDB

This is a Node.js application for building forms with user authentication, session management, cookies, and password hashing using MongoDB as the database. 

## Features
- **Form creation and submission**: Users can create forms and submit data.
- **User authentication**: Secure user login and registration using hashed passwords.
- **Sessions and Cookies**: Maintain session data across requests using cookies.
- **Password hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Session Management**: Express-Session
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **Cookies**: Built-in cookie handling via Express
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB installed and running

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/form-builder.git
   cd form-builder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/formbuilder
   SESSION_SECRET=yourSecretKey
   ```

4. Start the MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **User Registration**: Users can register by providing a username and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in MongoDB.

2. **User Login**: After registration, users can log in using their credentials. Sessions are stored and authenticated using Express-Session and cookies.

3. **Form Creation**: Once logged in, users can create forms and submit them.

4. **Session Management**: Session information is saved in cookies to keep users logged in.

## Key Modules

- **bcrypt**: Used for hashing and comparing passwords.
- **express-session**: Handles session creation and management.
- **connect-mongo**: Stores session information in MongoDB.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware to parse cookies.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from `.env` file.

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers with a username and password.
2. Password is hashed using bcrypt and stored in the database.
3. During login, the hashed password is compared with the stored hash.
4. On successful login, a session is created, and a cookie is sent to the client.
5. The user stays logged in across requests unless they log out or the session expires.

## Session Management

- **Sessions** are stored using `express-session`, and the session data is persisted in MongoDB using `connect-mongo`.
- **Cookies** are used to track session IDs and user login status. 

## Password Hashing

- The app uses bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- During login, bcrypt compares the hashed password with the stored hash to authenticate the user.

## Routes

- `/register`: User registration
- `/login`: User login
- `/logout`: User logout
- `/form`: Create a form (protected route)

## Security

- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt is used to hash and salt passwords.
- **Sessions**: Session data is securely stored in MongoDB, and cookies are signed with a secret key.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data like the database connection string and session secret are stored in environment variables.
